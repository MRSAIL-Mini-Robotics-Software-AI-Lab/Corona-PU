# Corona-PU

Computer Organisation and Architecture project, this project builds a computer from scratch (hardware and software) using VHDL  to build hardware components (that works on Xilinix simulator,) and python to build software components (Compiler and Assembler for BEMO, our programming language that is built with a memory management scheme.) We used our BEMO to create 3D rendering that works on our computer, cart-pole game and a reinforcement learning agent that learns how to play pole on our computer. 

### Project Components:
* ALU
* CPU
* FPU
* Memory
* VGA Controller
* Compiler 
* Assembler
* Applications including cart-pole balancing, and 3D Simulation
